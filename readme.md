# multicut algorithm for multi-stage problem with SSD constraint

### currently we work on a three-stage case (finite sencarios)
### Problem description:
First stage scenario (only one case as we think it realized first);

Second stage scenario index by: l = 1, ..,L

Third stage scenario index by: s = 1,...,S_l

So what to input:

(1) the dynamic of decisions

(2) reward function (random?)

(3) decision

(4)
